# pyDataverse

[![Project Status: Unsupported â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state but the author(s) have ceased all work on it. A new maintainer may be desired.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

pyDataverse is a Python module for [Dataverse](http://dataverse.org).
It helps to access the Dataverse [API's](http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/api/index.html) and manipulate, validate, import and export all Dataverse data-types (Dataverse, Dataset, Datafile).

# Running tests

In order to run the tests, you need to have a Dataverse instance running. We have prepared a shell script that will start a Dataverse instance using Docker that runs all tests in a clean environment. To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
# Defaults to Python 3.11
./run_tests.sh

# To run the tests with a specific Python version
./run_tests.sh -p 3.8
```

Once finished, you can find the test results in the `dv/unit-tests.log` file and in the terminal.

## Manual setup

If you want to run single tests you need to manually set up the environment and set up the necessary environment variables. Please follow the instructions below.

**1. Start the Dataverse instance**

```bash
docker compose \
    -f ./docker/docker-compose-base.yml \
    --env-file local-test.env \
    up -d
```

**2. Set up the environment variables**

```bash
export BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
export DV_VERSION=6.2 # or any other version
export $(grep "API_TOKEN" "dv/bootstrap.exposed.env")
export API_TOKEN_SUPERUSER=$API_TOKEN
```

**3. Run the test(s) with pytest**

```bash
python -m pytest -v
```
